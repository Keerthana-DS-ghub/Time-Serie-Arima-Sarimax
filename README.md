# Time-Serie-Arima-Sarimax

## 📌 Project Overview

This project focuses on applying classical time series forecasting models such as ARIMA, SARIMAX, and Auto ARIMA to analyze temporal patterns and generate accurate predictions. It covers the end-to-end pipeline — from data preprocessing and exploratory analysis to model development and evaluation — providing actionable insights into trends and seasonality.

## 🛠️  Tech Stack

🐍 Python — Core programming language for modeling and analysis

🧮 Pandas & NumPy — Data manipulation, transformation, and numerical operations

📊 Matplotlib & Seaborn — Data visualization and exploratory analysis

📈 Statsmodels — Implementation of ARIMA and SARIMAX models
